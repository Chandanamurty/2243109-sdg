						Conflict, insecurity, weak institutions and limited access to justice remain a great threat to sustainable development.
						The number of people fleeing war, persecution and conflict exceeded 70 million in 2018, the highest level recorded by the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) in almost 70 years.<br><br>
