            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the world’s best plan to build a better world for people and our planet by 2030. Adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, the SDGs are a call for action by all countries – poor, rich and middle-income – to promote prosperity while protecting the environment. They recognize that ending poverty must go hand-in-hand with strategies that build economic growth and address a range of social needs including education, health, equality and job opportunities while tackling climate change and working to preserve our ocean and forests.
            The SDGs are integrated—that is, they recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and that development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability. Through the pledge to Leave No One Behind, countries have committed to fast-track progress for those furthest behind first.
            That is why the SDGs are designed to bring the world to several life-changing ‘zeros’, including zero poverty, hunger, AIDS and discrimination against women and girls.<a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/#:~:text=The%20Sustainable%20Development%20Goals%20are,environmental%20degradation%2C%20peace%20and%20justice.">more info..</a>

            <b><u>History:</u></b><br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were born at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro in 2012. The objective was to produce a set of universal goals that meet the urgent environmental, political and economic challenges facing our world.
            The SDGs replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which started a global effort in 2000 to tackle the indignity of poverty. The MDGs established measurable, universally-agreed objectives for tackling extreme poverty and hunger, preventing deadly diseases, and expanding primary education to all children, among other development priorities.<br><br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;For 15 years, the MDGs drove progress in several important areas: reducing income poverty, providing much needed access to water and sanitation, driving down child mortality and drastically improving maternal health. They also kick-started a global movement for free primary education, inspiring countries to invest in their future generations. Most significantly, the MDGs made huge strides in combatting HIV/AIDS and other treatable diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis.<br><br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were developed at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2012. The purpose was to create a set of global goals, related with the environmental, political and economic challenges that we face as humanity.
            In this way, in 2015 the UN chose through a vote 17 objectives applicable universally to transform the world and has promoted them as global goals of sustainable development for the period 2015-2030, thus replacing the 8 Millennium Development Goals.<br><br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The SDGs are a commitment that seeks to address the most urgent problems of the world and they are all interrelated. They are a universal call to action to respond sustainably against the threat of climate change, having a positive impact in the way we manage our fragile natural resources, promoting peace and inclusive societies, to reduce inequalities and contribute to the prosperity of economies.
            Since the beginning of the SDGs, they have aimed at the so-called 2030 Agenda, which has provided a model for shared prosperity in a sustainable world, in which all people can lead productive lives, living peacefully and on a healthy planet.
